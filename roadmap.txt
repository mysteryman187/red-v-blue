single player....these 2 wold actually make this useful to me every day!
boxing mode...basically this would auto lap and make a noise and needs to let you config when that occurs...also useful to me
just allow config with similar to one i use..

rounds
round time
rest time
round warning also a must...
setup time is nice

so you can hit finish and we record the rounds completed
...also kinda needs to work with multiplayer...
although that makes no sense since yer both doin the same thing!
so yeah single play is pre-requisite

circuit mode/auto workout or is that the same thing?
...it might be simpler UI to treat them separate

so i config with:
burpees x20
squatsx20
then i hit start
then i want to hit lap after each exercise or after each circuit and i can config that


so for both above modes i need a menu to pick what we are doing

i think / route is menu1
SINGLE PLAYER
MULTI PLAYER



multi player
...previous setup is remembered

default has 2 players..they have default names(player 1, player 2)
there is an + button
...player just gets named player 3 ---DONT DO THIS FEATURE...IM NEVER GOING TO USE IT

there is a setting for start delay on this screen

i think now we just hit start and it goes to the game view we got now



single player

goes to settings first
which has a start delay setting
and you can pick a workout(circuit mode)
or you can pick boxing mode
and you can hit play





Feature:
workout descriptions
navigate from menu to new settings screen
there is then a text area to fill in

..buut that is shit!
i need to write it at the gym???
suppose it could be done before and left on that screen?
ok this is still the way to go
another feature makes it better


Feature:
workout templates
these show on the pre-race settings screen as a list of buttons
so you need to name the template and the names on the button
and its got
{
	startupTime: 15,
	description: 15
}
template screen also has a delete button and back button
there is a button on teh / menu to get to templates



================================================CHECKPOINT=====================================
ALL ABOVE IS DONE EXCEPT FOR BOXING MODE
and templates/settings dont look too pretty

Feature:
post workout comments
basically a textarea on history view
... this is the last feature to make this app usable to me everyday instad of timer+memo


ok back after 6 months away...hiii!
Now i do corssfitish workouts all the time and I want to the app to do some more stuff!
I can maybe just enhance the templates a little with:

Laps - this would auto-finish once I hit Lap this many times...but I can always hit finish before if I give up
Lap Time - this would auto-lap after the lap time went
lap buzzer - this would make a noise when it auto-Laps
start buzzer - this would make a noise when a lap starts
break-time - this would be a timer which starts after either - the user laps or auot-laps - the GUI would indicate its break time
named laps - this would display the lap name as text while the lap is going(allows me to put an exercise name in there so i can know what to do)
	-	this could wedge into running mode which would just need to display how fast to run as the name
	- also the clock probably is counting down for running mode
maximum time - this would auto-finish after this much time elapsed and makes a noise
lap warning - select a time and it makes a noise that many seconds before the end of the lap


Feature:
Running mode

WHEN I pick Running mode from the menu
ThEN On the setting screen
AND I always need to pick a speed
OR I can pick a distance
OR I can pick a time
THEN it should show me the distance i will cover if i picked a time
OR it should show me the time I will go for if I picked a distance


THEN the play screen then shows
Time elapsed - does already
Time Remaining
Distance covered based on speed and time
Distance Remaining based on speed and time

the play screen needs to stop the clock by itself aftr the time/distance is covered
and for now its all metric...miles is another feature

Feature:
change units to miles in running mode



Bugfix:
make tempaltes/settings screens look pretty...they look shit!
